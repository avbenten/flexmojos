AIR plugin

  The AIR Plugin is used to compile the sources of your flex project.
  This plugin uses the opensource flex compiler oem to compile the sources.
  
  This Flex Compiler Plugin can create application and library files for both
  Flex and AIR depending on the package.

* Goals Overview

  The Flex Compiler Plugin has two goals.  Both are already bound to their proper
  phases within the Maven Lifecycle and are therefore, automatically executed
  during their respective phases.

  * {{{compile-swf-mojo.html}flex-compiler-mojo:compile-swf}} is bound to the compile phase and
  is used to compile the main Flex source files into an application file. Depending on the
  package type, either a Flex application (swf) or AIR application (aswf) is created.

  * {{{compile-swc-mojo.html}flex-compiler-mojo:compile-swc}} is bound to the compile phase and
  is used to compile a library file. Depending on the package type, either a Flex library (swc)
  or AIR library (aswc) is created.

  * {{{compile-resource-bundle-mojo.html}flex-compiler-mojo:compile-resource-bundle}} is bound to the compile phase and
  is used to compile a resource bundle.

  * {{{test-compile-mojo.html}flex-compiler-mojo:test-compile}} is bound to the
  test-compile phase and is used to compile the Flex test source files.

  * {{{test-run-mojo.html}flex-compiler-mojo:test-run}} is bound to the
  test phase and is used to run the Flex tests.

* Usage

  Instructions on how to use the Compiler Plugin can be found
  {{{usage.html}here}}.
  
* Default Flex Configuration

  Below the default configuration which is used to compile the Flex sources. 
  This configuration can be changed by adding a configuration section to the plugin in your
  pom. See {{{usage.html}usage}} for more information.

  The flex compiler includes the fonts for both Windows and Mac. Depending on the system on which the compilation
  is done, the correct fonts file is copied to the target directory.
